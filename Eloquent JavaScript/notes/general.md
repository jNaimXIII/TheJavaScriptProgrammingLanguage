### Definitions

- **Programming** - Programming is the act of constructing a program --- a set
  of precise instructions telling a computer what to do
- **Programming Language** - A programming language is an artificially
  constructed language used to instruct computers.
- **Code** - Code is the text that makes up programs.

### Programming Concepts

- **while** continues executing the block (wrapped in braces) below it as long
  as the condition it was given holds.

### History

- At one point language-based interfaces, such as the BASIC and DOS prompts of
  the 1980s and 1990s, were the main method of interacting with computers.
- To program early computers, it was necessary to set large arrays of switches
  in the right position or punch holes in strips of cardboard and feed them to
  the computer.
- JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
  Netscape Navigator browser.
- It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the
  programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by marketing
  considerations rather than good judgment.
- After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written
  to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various
  pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking
  about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the
  Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the
  terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two
  names for the same language.
- There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript version 3 was
  the widely supported version in the time of JavaScript’s ascent to dominance,
  roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was underway on
  an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical improvements and
  extensions to the language. Changing a living, widely used language in such a
  radical way turned out to be politically difficult, and work on the version 4
  was abandoned in 2008, leading to a much less ambitious version 5, which made
  only some uncontroversial improvements, coming out in 2009. Then in 2015
  version 6 came out, a major update that included some of the ideas planned
  for version 4. Since then we’ve had new, small updates every year.

### Fun Concepts

- You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.
- A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless,
  and it grows easily under our typing hands.
- When a program works, it is beautiful.
- They have composed strict rules (“best practices”) prescribing the form
  programs should have and carefully stay within their safe little zone.
- A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not
  learned from a list of rules.
- A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk
  about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level. It helps
  omit details, provides convenient building blocks (such as while and
  console.log), allows you to define your own building blocks (such as sum and
  range), and makes those blocks easy to compose.
